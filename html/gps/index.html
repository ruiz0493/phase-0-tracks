#Reflect Portion

#The purpose of Semantic tags is to bring meaning to the line a code that you are witting. I belive most semantic tags are extremely useful because you can run into a situation where you will need most of them. The <nav> semantic tag is my favorite because everytime Im reading a website I like to find more information about the topic. 

#The order the browser uses to display contents on  a page is by how the HTML page is laid out. When you write basic HTML code it displays the head then body portion of the page because it makes more sense for a reader to navigate through the page that way. 

#Learning about snippets and on how to create them is one of the most useful things Ive learned about sublime. I will definately use snippets in the future because I find them to be very useful when creating large projects. 

#Learning the overall concept of snippets was a little difficult for me because it was a new concept introduced to me. I will most likely practice using them in the future so I can become more skilled at using them.
