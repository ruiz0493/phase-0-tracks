- For everytime you enter a elevator:
  -Until you hear a number called out by your master: 
     -you wait until you master tells you through your voice recognition software which floor he would like to go to. 
     - Once your master tells you a number, you press that number on the elevator control panel.
     -After the number is pressed you wait until the elevator stops and opens. 
  -If no number is called out
     -Assume that your master is going to the first floor and press the 1 button.
