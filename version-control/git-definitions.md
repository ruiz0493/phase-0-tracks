# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* What is a merge conflict?

1. Version control is a useful way for programmers to view the entire history of revisions that were made to one or more files and merge revisions made by diffrent people. It is useful so programmers can see the cycle of certain revisions made to a file or folder to better understand the reasoning behind them. 

2. A branch is a copy of your project so you can work on it and make revisions as needed. It allows you to create diffrent branches and merge them back into a master branch when completed with the overall project. 

3. A commit is a save point in Git that shows you the reasoning behind a revision that was made to a file or folder. A good commit message will be specific so everyone can see why the change was made to that sepcific folder or file. 

4. A merge conflict is when two seperate branches have changed the same past of the same file and are merged together.
